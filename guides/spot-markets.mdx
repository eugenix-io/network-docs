## Overview

Spot markets on LogX Network allow users to **buy and sell tokens instantly at real-time market prices** with **on-chain transparency, security, and efficiency**. Unlike derivatives, **spot trading involves direct ownership of assets**, making it ideal for long-term holding or active trading.

**Many pre-market tokens transition to spot markets** once they officially launch at TGE, providing a seamless trading experience for early investors.
