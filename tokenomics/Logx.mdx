# Announcing $LOGX: The Native Token of LogX Network



The LogX Foundation is proud to unveil **`$LOGX`**, the native governance and gas fee token of **LogX Network**, marking a significant advancement in growing a fully community-driven protocol. The **`$LOGX`** governance token is set to play a pivotal role in empowering LogX users and contributors to impact decision-making processes and guide the future direction of the LogX ecosystem.

## Why Now?

LogX V1 launched in August 2023. Since then, LogX has grown to become the most omnipresent perp DEX live across 17 EVM networks. LogX V1 has crossed a cumulative trading volume of $20+ billion. We thank the 1.2M+ users who have used the LogX Platform for trading derivatives.

Building on a solid foundation established over the past one year, our ambitions started evolving LogX into a suite of consumer use cases beyond the perp DEX. LogX Network, set out to unlock the next phase of growth, will bring exotic perps, leveraged prediction markets, and much more to the DeFi market.

`$LOGX` is the native governance and gas fee token of the LogX Network. With the launch of the upcoming LogX Network main-net, `$LOGX` will drive the future of the protocol.
