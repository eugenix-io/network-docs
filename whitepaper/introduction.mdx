**LogX Network is the world’s first on-chain consumer super app!**

The LogX Network is meticulously designed to deliver exceptional performance and cost-efficient infrastructure tailored for trading, enabling the development of multiple consumer apps specifically catered to retail trading.

With LogX Network, our vision is to create a trading infrastructure that:

1. **Outperforms Centralised Exchanges (CEXs):** We aim to provide a user experience that not only matches but surpasses that of traditional centralised exchanges, offering superior speed, security, and ease of use.
2. **Supports Millions of Users:** Our infrastructure is built to handle a massive user base, ensuring reliability and performance even under the highest demands.
3. **Scales Across 50+ Blockchain Networks:** With a design focused on interoperability, LogX can seamlessly scale to over 50 blockchain networks, ensuring broad compatibility and extensive reach.
4. **Can Support Multiple Retail Consumer Products:** LogX Network infrastructure can support multiple retail products like leveraged prediction markets, spot trading and meme coin launchpads with an iOS-like experience.

LogX Network stands as a powerhouse in infrastructure, offering:

-   **_Over 30,000 Transactions Per Second (TPS)_:** Ensuring fast and reliable trading for all.
-   **_Approximately 100 ms Latency_:** Delivering near-instantaneous transaction speeds.
-   **_Gasless Trading and one-click trading experience_:** For a CEX-like trading experience
-   **_Ability to support multiple asset types_:** Not just derivatives

## **LogX’s Mission**

At LogX, our mission is a bold yet simple one: to ensure that the trading experience in decentralised finance (DeFi) not only matches that of centralised finance (CeFi) but also surpasses it. We've seen firsthand the immense potential of self-custody of assets and firmly believe that DeFi is an inherently superior value proposition compared to CeFi, despite the obstacles. Our commitment is towards bringing the best execution of trades to our traders.

The name "LogX" came from the logarithmic function, a fundamental concept in mathematics that underpins crucial calculations in finance, such as volatility measurement, portfolio optimisation, and options pricing. By adopting this name, we underscore the intricate mathematical modelling that lies at the core of our advanced trading protocol, highlighting our dedication to precision and sophistication in the realm of DeFi.

## Acknowledgements

Numerous perpetual decentralised exchanges have been established prior to LogX, and we deeply appreciate the work they have accomplished. These platforms have not only influenced our development but have also served as a source of inspiration for us.

We are convinced that decentralised finance (DeFi) significantly enhances the user experience over traditional centralised finance, thereby playing an important role in shaping the future of the global financial ecosystem. The growing demand for DeFi solutions across a diverse range of needs reinforces the urgency for innovation in this space.

We want to give particular shoutouts to the teams that built GMX, Hyperliquid, AEVO, and Vertex. We are not just admirers but have also learnt a lot from your work.

## **Executive Summary**

LogX Network is a cutting-edge modular trading infrastructure designed for unparalleled scalability across all blockchain networks. As the pioneering trading layer for universal scalability, LogX leads the charge in innovation. Boasting over 30,000 TPS, ~100ms latency, a seamless CEX-like trading experience, and support for multiple asset types, LogX is set to bring millions of traders on-chain, delivering exceptional performance without compromise. While we build on our vision, our journey has also been supported by esteemed partners like IOSG, Hashed EM, Coinbase, and more!

## **High-Level Operational Summary**

LogX is a perpetuals trading platform. A perpetual contract is a derivative that approximates leveraged spot trading. Investors can buy to gain from rising prices or sell to gain from falling prices. The perpetual contract differs from traditional futures in some ways: it has no expiration time and therefore no restrictions on how long users can hold a position. To ensure that the underlying price index is tracked, perpetual contracts are guaranteed to follow the price of the underlying asset through a funding fee mechanism. Another important difference is that traditional futures assets are transferred at settlement time, but that’s not the case in perpetuals.

### **Key advantages of perps trading vs spot trading**

-   **_Leverage_**: In spot trading, you need the full amount of capital to purchase an asset. For example, if a token's price is 30,000 USDC, you would need 30,000 USDC in your account to buy just one token. In contrast, perpetual trading allows you to use leverage, significantly reducing the capital required to open a position. With a 10x leverage on LogX Network, for instance, you can open a position equivalent to owning one token for just 3,000 USDC in collateral. This means you're controlling a 30,000 USDC position with only 3,000 USDC, making your trading much more capital-efficient. Perpetual contracts allow you to amplify your exposure to price movements without needing to fully own the underlying asset, unlike spot trading where full ownership is required.
-   **_Ability to long or short_**: if you hold a token in the spot market, you can benefit only from its potential price appreciation. On the other hand, perpetual futures contracts allow you to profit from price movements in either direction; you can bet that the price of an asset will fall by entering a short position and profit from its downtrend.
-   **_Liquidity_:** Futures market volume surpasses by far spot trading volume, allowing users to access deeper liquidity and trade with a minimal price impact.

## Why LogX Network?

The current crypto derivatives market trades approximately `$3 trillion`in volume per month or `$97 billion` per day, constituting up to **80% of total crypto trade volumes**.

Traditionally, **99% of derivatives trading** occurs on **centralised exchanges (CEXs)**. However, CEXs face significant issues, particularly concerning transparency and fund custody. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) emerged to address these problems.

Despite this, existing on-chain derivatives exchange products fall short in terms of liquidity, fees, speed, and user experience when compared to CEXs. Currently, only **1-2% of all crypto futures** are traded on-chain.

In addition to this, there is a lack of high-performance consumer apps on chain. The main obstacles preventing a larger audience from moving on-chain are:

-   Lack of high-performance on-chain trading infrastructure
-   Liquidity fragmentation across various networks, especially newer ones
-   High gas fees
-   Latency for on chain confirmation
-   Repeated metamask signing
-   Lack of seamless consumer apps

To address these fundamental infrastructure challenges, we are building the LogX Network.

## LogX Network’s Edge

The LogX Network is designed specifically for on chain trading, optimised to support over 30,000 transactions per second (TPS) and a block time of approximately 100 milliseconds. The network leverages best-in-class infrastructure, including:

-   **Built on the Arbitrum Orbit Stack:** Providing a robust and scalable foundation.
-   **Avail Network for Data Availability:** Ensuring reliable and secure data access.
-   **Hyperlane Network for Cross-Chain Messaging and Bridging:** Facilitating seamless communication across multiple networks.
-   **Alt Layer for Network Construction:** Enhancing the overall network architecture.

We have designed a novel trading engine that assigns each token its own "Buying Power" rather than considering tokens at face value for matching orders and margins. This approach allows LogX Network to onboard tokens from any new chain, regardless of associated risks. This unique capability enables LogX Network to scale across new ecosystems, such as BTC L2s, faster than any other perpetual DEX.
