### **Smart Contract Risk**

    The on-chain Perp DEX is inherently dependent on the security and correctness of the underlying smart contracts. Any bugs, vulnerabilities, or exploits in these contracts could result in the loss of user funds, making thorough audits and ongoing security monitoring essential.

### **L1 Risk**

    LogX operates across multiple EVM-compatible L1 and L2 networks. These networks may experience downtime or disruptions due to consensus failures, network congestion, or other technical issues, potentially impacting the availability and performance of the LogX platform.

### **Market Liquidity Risk**

    In the early stages, there is a risk of low market liquidity, which can lead to significant price slippage during trades. This could negatively impact the trading experience, causing unexpected losses for traders and reducing the platform's overall attractiveness.

### **Oracle Manipulation Risk**

    LogX relies on price oracles managed by validators to provide accurate market data. If an oracle is compromised or manipulated, it could lead to inaccurate pricing, resulting in unintended liquidations or other adverse outcomes before the price is corrected to its true market value.

### **Platform Risk**

    LogX Network integrates with multiple third-party partners to power its ecosystem. Any disruptions or issues with these partners could directly impact LogX users. Additionally, LogX relies on Hyperlane for fund transmission, which may experience downtime or other operational issues, affecting the platform's reliability.
