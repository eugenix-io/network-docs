LogX has also designed a **Trade & Earn system** that rewards users **fairly and transparently** based on their activity. Every time you trade, you earn tokens from a **treasure chest** filled with rewards—calculated on your **trading fees** and engagement.

🔹 **Instant Rewards:** Your earnings appear **immediately** after each trade.

🔹 **$LOGX Loaded:** More tokens, **coming soon!**

🔹 **Fair & Transparent:** Rewards scale based on your **real trading activity.**
